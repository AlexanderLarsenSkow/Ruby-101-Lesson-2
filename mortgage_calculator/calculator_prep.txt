Understanding the Problem: We need to take several pieces of information from the user (loan amount, annual percentage rate,
and loan duration in years. 

From there, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate (APR / 12) and the loan duration in months (years / 12) 

Expected Input: 

User Data. User needs to input the loan amount, percentage rate per year, and the loan duration in years.

Expected Output:

Monthly payments required to pay off the loan in the time given.


Psudo Code: 

GET userdata for the loan amount.
VALIDATE the input is an integer. LOOP error message if not a valid integer. Prewritten method 
SET loan amount value to new variable.

GET userdata for APR 
VALIDATE the input is a valid float or integer. LOOP error message if not valid. Prewritten method
CALCULATE MPR.  
SET to new variable.

GET userdata for loan duration.
VALIDATE the input is a float or integer (not sure which now). LOOP error message if not valid. Prewritten method
CALCULATE monthly duration. 
SET equal to new variable.

CALCULATE monthly payments with forumula.
DISPLAY the result to the user.
LOOP if they want to check again or input a new loan.

Problems to Solve: 


-Using a standard industry APR of 7.10% doesn't pass current validation checks because of 
	the 0.

SOLVED
-Using a float conversion method in the final monthly_payment variable assignment creates too many decimal places.
	Using the integer conversion method removes all decimals. Figure out a way to keep two decimal places.

SOLVED	
-Negative numbers in user input doesn't create errors. Update the validation methods to account for this.
